Proteoglycan project 

1) Preprocess expression file and clinical file
2) Decide expression cutoff to filter out potential housekeeping genes
3) Create overview of genes in each cancer type above cutoff value
4) Decide cutoff expression value to determine patients in high vs low expression groups
5) Use the cutoff values in a Cox univariate analysis to decide if the expression has an impact on either DSS or PFI
